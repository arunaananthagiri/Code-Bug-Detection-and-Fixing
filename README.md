### Features

- Web interface to input Python code
- Automatic detection of bugs and errors
- Suggests and applies appropriate fixes
- Uses open-source machine learning models
- Returns the corrected version of the code

### Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Machine Learning: Pre-trained open-source models for code error detection and correction
